## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1.	Familiarize students with **linked lists**
2.  Familiarize students with **array storage** and **linked storage**.
3.  Practice **time complexity** analysis.

## Program
Add functionality for the incomplete data structure functions.  

Modify this README document with a paragraph (at least three complete sentences) explaining why the different storage methods are better for the different lists used in the driver.
# EXPLANATION GOES UNDER HERE 
In this project, we are using a Linked List for our todo list, and an Array List for completed items. It is useful to use the Linked List for the todo list because we can assign priority to the items we add, which means some items will be inserted into the list and this only takes O(1) linear time. The Array is useful because it is easier to use and we don't need referance pointers, since items completed just go to the back of the list.
